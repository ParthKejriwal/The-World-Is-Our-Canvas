In this project you are required to use the concept of firebase to connect your
drawing information to firebase.
IMPORTANT: The canvas sends information to firebase in real-time. All the other
canvases need to get this information and automatically draw on the canvas.
You will have to make use javascript arrays for this project.
Remember to initialize your database and creating a reference to the location of
your data - database.ref()
Also remember to use the function .on() to find out if your canvas changed it’s
value.
HERE’S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD CREATE:

I hope this app makes you excited for the future project and helps you realise how
awesome collaborative creativity is.
